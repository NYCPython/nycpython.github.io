# Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as organizers and members pledge to making participation in our project and our community a safe and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

# Our Standards

## Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:


* Being friendly and patient
* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members



## Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:


* The use of sexualized or violent language or imagery
* Unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment. If someone asks you to stop, then stop.
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting



# Our Responsibilities

Organizers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Organizers have the right and responsibility to enforce this Code of Conduct. They may ban temporarily or permanently any member for behaviors that violate this Code of Conduct, or for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Organizers are held to a higher standard than other community members. If an organizer creates an inappropriate situation, they should expect a strong reprimand for their behavior.

# Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within the spaces where the meetup takes place and in public spaces outside the meetup where members may interact. Violations of this Code of Conduct outside the meetup may affect a person's ability to participate in the meetup.

#Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the organizers. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The organizers are obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Organizers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other organizers.
