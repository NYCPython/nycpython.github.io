                We host a variety of event nights, with our most frequent being our
                <strong>Project Night</strong>. See below for a list of our typical events.

                        <strong>Project Night</strong>: Our weekly meetup, usually hosted on Wednesdays at 6:30 PM EST.
                        <p>
                            Project night is a loosely organized hacker space 
                            for Python programmers of varying levels of
                            experience to work on personal projects and learn from
                            one another.

                        <strong>Lightning Talks</strong>: Your chance to show off what you've been working on!
                        <p>
                            Got a project you've been working on and want to show it off?
                            Have an idea for a tech talk and you'd like to try it out?
                            Want to practice your public speaking skills?
                            If you said yes to any of the above, our lightning
                             talk events are a great place to get your feet wet.
                            Lightning talks are short technical talks about projects that you are working on,
                            or techniques that you use for learning or your work. Try it out!
                        </p>

                        <strong>Talk Night</strong>: Your chance to show off what you've been working on!
                        <p>
                            This event is more serious than lightning talk night. The talks are curated by us, the organizers, for you.
                            What to expect: two to three in-depth talks about community, software, self-edification,
                            not always having to do explicitly with Python or the Python ecosystem.
